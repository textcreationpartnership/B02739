            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALtho there be no <hi>Christian</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but is sufficiently satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and does very well know, that <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, is the <hi>One thing Necessary;</hi> and the Indispensible Duty of every Man and Woman that do desire to be <hi>Saved:</hi> Yet such has been, and more especially in this present Generation, is the miserable depravity of Human Nature, that we are too too apt to <hi>defer</hi> that till last, that ought to be our first and chiefest care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. To enforce and convince you of the necessity of this great <hi>Duty,</hi> is the design of this <hi>Treatise;</hi> of which never was there greater need than <hi>Now;</hi> when Men are so far from making this their <hi>greatest care</hi> and <hi>Concern,</hi> that they can hardly
<pb facs="tcp:179404:6"/> spare a thought upon their <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi> For the enforcing this most necessary <hi>Duty</hi> upon the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Minds</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sermons</hi> are very useful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. The Time and Opportunity of receiving <hi>Grace</hi> may easily be let slip; it is therefore the <hi>Duty</hi> of every <hi>Christian</hi> to lay hold upon the present Opportunity, and to accept of <hi>Grace;</hi> now, instantly, while <hi>Grace</hi> is to be had. The learned <hi>Pharisees</hi> could not discern their <hi>Opportunity</hi> by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Signs</hi> of his <hi>Coming,</hi> as you have it in <hi>Mat. 19.</hi> at the beginning Neither could the <hi>Jews</hi> know their <hi>Opportunity, it was hidden from their Eyes,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Luke 19. 42. Opportunity</hi> is hardly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; therefore it becomes every wise Man to lay hold of her fore-top, and not let her pass, least he hereafter sorely repent it. But <hi>who is the Wise-man?</hi> says <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 8. That is, how
<pb facs="tcp:179404:6"/> rarely is the <hi>Wise-man</hi> to be found? For the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> saith he, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Time and Judgment.</hi> That is to say, he is able to discern <hi>When</hi> things are to be done, and therefore its rare to find such a Wise Man; in the Voyage to <hi>Heaven</hi> it is hard to save our <hi>Tide:</hi> Not one of a thousand but lets it slip. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of this therefore, is a Man's greatest <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Deut. <hi>32. 29. O that they were Wise, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their latter End.</hi> The <hi>Wise Man's heart is said to be in his right-hand,</hi> That is, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> teacheth him to manage his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs judiciously, and in season. That Man, who tho' he be never so Wise and Prudent in the World and Worldly things, yet if he hath not <hi>Wisdom</hi> to know the <hi>Season</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> he may well be termed a <hi>Scripture-Fool,</hi> and will so appear to himself and others too, to all <hi>Eternity:</hi> And will it not (think
<pb facs="tcp:179404:7"/> you) cause the greatest Torment and Vexation imaginable to that Man, who when he comes to <hi>Die,</hi> shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to say, O never was I wise, who was wise for every thing, but to <hi>save my Soul?</hi> laying hold of the present op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in that which facilitates every action and employment, making a work come off smoothly, and with facility. The gracious God, if we embrace an Opportunity, offereth to help us, and work with us. O the goodness of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, that tho he sets us so light and easie a task, yet offers to work with us too! That Burthen is more light and easie, when two persons assist in the carrying of it, than it would be upon the back of one. When the Boat has the advantage both of <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Tide,</hi> to carry it forward, it goes easily and pleasantly on. This is the case of that <hi>Christian,</hi> who seasonably embraces the Offers of Grace and Mercy: He has the Assistance of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:179404:7"/> for the obtaining his desired happiness. To lay hold of the present Opportunity, makes every <hi>action</hi> look beautiful: It makes all our Performances look with a lovely Aspect, and with a Grace, <hi>Eccl. 3. 11. He hath made every thing beautiful in its Time,</hi> &amp;c. We all know, that <hi>Fruit</hi> gathered in <hi>season</hi> is the pleasantest <hi>Fruit,</hi> and that a <hi>word spoke in season,</hi> is a word upon Wheels. When the <hi>season</hi> of obtaining <hi>Grace</hi> is past, our endeavours are unpleasant to God, as well as unprofitable to us: Nor is that all, but we are accountable for every Opportunity we let slip and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for we are not only Accountable for every Action we commit, but for the time we do it in, <hi>Eccl 11. 9. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but know thou that for all these things, God
<pb facs="tcp:179404:8"/> will bring thee to Judgment:</hi> Where you see he shall be not only <hi>judged</hi> for his <hi>Actions,</hi> but for the <hi>Time</hi> he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>mispent.</hi> O that <hi>every Christian</hi> would lay this <hi>seriously to heart,</hi> and <hi>contemplate</hi> thus with himself, <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the neglecting of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,</hi> is the greatest <hi>Destroy</hi> in the World.

            <p>We see <hi>Opportunity</hi> is embraced by all persons in their <hi>meanest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns;</hi> and shall not a <hi>Christian</hi> much more lay hold of all <hi>Opportunities</hi> for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his <hi>Soul?</hi> Doth not the <hi>Husbandman</hi> observe his <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?</hi> the <hi>Merchant</hi> his? the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, the very work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Iniquity</hi> observe <hi>Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Seasons,</hi> wherein they may best performe their Delights; and shall only the precious <hi>Opportunities</hi> for the good of our Souls be neglected? This <hi>Delaying</hi> in the pursuit of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> is a <hi>Delaying</hi> to be freed from the <hi>greatest Evil, (viz.)</hi> the Wrath of God, Guilt, Damnation and Hell.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:179404:9"/>
            <p>Wherefore, O <hi>Christians,</hi> let it be your great and immediate care, to make your <hi>Peace</hi> between God and your own Souls.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st appearance in a publick Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Boast not thy self of to Morrow, for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179404:43"/> thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> Ah Sinner, thou wilt be found to be the <hi>Fool</hi> of all <hi>Fools,</hi> that dost not know how soon thou mayest depart this World, yet triflest and delayest, and wilt not make hast to come to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thy time that is past, will never come again; if thou wouldst give thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands for Yesterday, it cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called: Or for last Lord's day, it cannot be Recalled again: Consider your time, then judge if it be not high time for you to make hast, and to delay no longer.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Yet I pray you consider, all the time you do delay you are abusing the Mercy of God, and abusing of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God; Is this a thing to delay in? Does the Eternal God stay, yet does not Damn thee, and cast thee down to Hell, which he may do every Hour at his Pleasure? And does he tarry and not Punish thee? And dost thou tarry and wilt not come and submit to him? This God is intreating of thee to accept of Mercy, and is loth that thou shouldst Perish, or lose thy poor Soul. Now is offering of the Rich Blessings, Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so dear, as by the blood of his own Son? and while thou dost neglect,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179404:43"/> What dost thou but say in thy heart I care not for God, nor for his Christ neither? Ah Sinner, remember the time is coming, the hour is hastning, that thou wouldst give Ten <hi>Thousand</hi> Worlds if thou hadst them, for that Grace which now thou despisest, <hi>Rom. 7. despisest thou the goodness of God, not considering that the Patience and Long-suffering of God should lead thee to repentance!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. Thy Delaying has in it a great deal of bold, and blind Presumption. Thou dost presume, Sinner, of such things that thou hast not any grounds to make reckoning of. There are three or four things that a trifling Sinner, a delaying Sinner presumes of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou dost presume that thou shalt live longer yet; thou dost presume, that thou hast more time to spend in this World; thou dost suppose that thou mayst have another Year yet, another Month still, another Week still; Tell me if this be not in thy Heart; Thou art worse than a mad-man indeed, that wilt not make hast and come to Christ? but this is a bold presumption; thou talkest of another Year, when thou mayst not have another Hour.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:179404:44"/>2. Thou dost presume, that thou canst Repeut when thou wilt, and turn to God when thou wilt; thou dost presume that thy own <hi>will</hi> is of thy own strength; but Sinner either thou canst Repent when thou wilt, or thou canst not; if thou canst and dost not, behold thou art inexcusable; but if thou canst not Repent now, dost thou think thou canst better Repent hereafter, when thou hast hardened thy Heart yet more in Sin?</p>
            <p n="3">3. In thy Delaying, thou dost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that the Spirit of God will help thee hereafter, as well as now, for if this were not in thy hopes, if thou didst not suppose this, if thou wert not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of thy Understanding, Wouldst not thou Repent now, while the Spirit of God moves upon thy heart? How dost thou know, but hereafter the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God may let the alone, and give thee up to the hardness of thy own Heart? God may say to thee, as to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hosea 4. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Ah Sinner, if God says once, <hi>Let him alone,</hi> then all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the world will do no good: If God would say to the delaying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>My Spirit let him alone, and mine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:179404:44"/>
               <hi>let him alone, and my Ministers let him alone;</hi> That tho you have the voice of the Gospel in your Ears, yet God will let thy heart alone.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And the last <hi>Argument</hi> to persuade you to make hast is this, it may be you may be loth to hear it; I wish, Sinner, that by the yeilding to all the rest, thou wouldest give me Reason to forbear to speak it; but if all that has been said, will not move thee to make hast, then know that thy Damnation is hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the time of thy lying in Torment is hastening, the hour of thy being thrown down to Devils, and lying in Chains of Darkness, is hastening. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, tho thou slumberest, yet thy Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation does not slumber, 2 <hi>Pet 2. 3. Whose Judgment now of a long time linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and their Damnation lingereth not.</hi> Thou lingerest and loyterst, ay, but thy Damnation does not slumber, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. Consider of that place, <hi>To me,</hi> says God, <hi>belongeth Vengeance and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; their foot shall slide in due time, for the Day of their Calamity is at hand, and the thing that shall come upon thee maketh hast.</hi> Mark, the Day of thy Calamity is at hand, and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:179404:45"/> thing, the Wrath of God that shall come upon thee maketh hast; the Justice of God that shall overtake thee, makes hast. O then, if thou would'st make hast to escape those dreadful things that are hastening, do you make hast and delay not to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your God.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives; and if I thought that you had made hast and come away to Christ, I would change my Text and go upon another Subject, but I doubt, after all, that thou art lingring; I would therefore yet try to put thee on, and would direct this Exhortation to five sorts of People.</p>
            <p>First of all, I would perswade such of you as are Young, that you would make hast, and not delay, even you that are Children, little Children, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est amongst you that understand what the sense is of any of these things. O do you make hast you young Men in your Youth make hast and do not delay.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I would direct this <hi>Exhortation</hi> to such of you as are old, old Sinners, for <hi>God</hi>'s sake make hast, you that are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years old and more, make hast.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:179404:45"/>III. To such of you as are Strong and Healthful of Body.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To you that are Sickly and Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Persons, often Sick and seldom Well, for God's sake make hast.</p>
            <p n="5">V. To such of you as have been Sick, and now are Well, as have been upon Beds of Sickness near to Death, but God hath set thee upon thy Legs again. O make hast, and do not delay to keep the Commandments of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, You that are young, you that are yet in your Childhood, you young Children, you Young men and Maids; O do you make hast, and do not delay to keep the Commandments of God. I would rather press this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel upon you, because you chiefly lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptations of delay; for you Children have very naughty hearts, and loth to be good, and come to God; you are apt to think, that you have time enough yet: that you may take your Pleasure and mind your Sports now, and think of God hereafter, and think of Heaven and Hell hereafter. But I have Ten Questions to propose to you, you Young ones, and by that time I have come through these, I hope you will see
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:179404:46"/> that there is no <hi>Reason</hi> for you to delay, tho you are young.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Tell me, Are you so young that <hi>you may not die?</hi> are you so young that <hi>you may not be sick?</hi> Are you <hi>Young Men</hi> exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Grave?</hi> Have you not observed, that as <hi>young as you,</hi> and <hi>younger</hi> too, have gone down to <hi>the Grave?</hi> Have you not seen little <hi>Infants</hi> carried to the <hi>Grave?</hi> Have not you seen <hi>Infants</hi> laid in the Dust? Have you not seen many times that their is but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Birth</hi> and the <hi>Grave?</hi> If you doubt of this, go into some <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> and see if you may not find there Graves of all sizes; an Infant was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, another young one was buried there, who was not so tall as <hi>I;</hi> Very well, if you are not so young, but you may die, are you so young then, that you may not make your Peace with God?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Are you so young that you may not be damned? Has God any where told you in his Word, that No Young Ones shall go to Hell, those that die in their Youth? Tell me, were not you born in Sin? And are you not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Children of Wrath? And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179404:46"/> of that sin in which you were born, are you not liable to the wrath of God, to the Damnation of Hell, and to the Torments of the Damned? Besides, Have not you Young Men many sins of your own commiting, actual Sins? How soon didst thou learn to Lye? How soon did you learn to take God's Holy Name in vain? How soon did you play upon the Lord's Day, and so mispend your precious time? By all these you have deserved Death and Hell too? and if you are not so Young, but you may be Damned, is there any room for you to delay, and not to do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to do?</p>
            <p n="3">III. I pray tell me, Is it fit that you should give the first of your <hi>time</hi> to the Devil, rather than unto God; for you first to serve the Devil, than next to serve <hi>God;</hi> to give your Youth unto him that would devour and destroy your Souls, rather than to <hi>God,</hi> that would save your Souls, and make them happy? Should you give to <hi>Satan</hi> the first of your time, that deserves none at all? And Sirs, I tell you, that you deserve to be Damned, if you give one hour. Think of it, What would the World think of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179404:47"/> you if you deal with your Parents as you deal with the Eternal God? if you should say, <hi>Father I will rebel against you while I am Young, I will vex and grieve you whilst Young, but I will be Dutiful to you when I am Old;</hi> Will you in effect say worse to God? And say, We will do what the Devil saith to us now, and we will do what God commands us hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Tell me, Who was it that gave you your <hi>Being?</hi> Who was it that formed you in your Mothers Womb? Who was it that brought you forth? Who was it that preserved you, whilst you hung upon your Mothers Breast? Who is it that kept you from Death and Hell to this day, that might have cast you into utter Darkness, as soon as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Light of the Sun? Has the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil done for you, as God has done, or can you expect he shall or will? Lay all these together, then see if it be fitting that you should serve the Devil first.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Tell me, you that are young, Can you be good too soon? Or can you love your God too soon? Or can you mind your Souls too soon? Or can you (think you) be mindful to escape the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell too soon? Can you be too
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179404:47"/> soon sure of Heaven? Tell me, Would it do thee any harm to know in thy Youth that thy Soul shall be saved? Would it do thee any harm to believe in Christ, to love God above all, and to understand, whenever thou shalt die, that thy Soul should be received to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Remember this, that there have been many who have been troubled that they did repent too late, but there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one in this World that ever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he repented too soon. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and Ten Thousands have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed that they have staid off from Christ so long.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Is not Youth, and Young in Years, the usual time for God to Convert Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his Son? especially, those whom he planteth under the Gospel in the time of their Youth. O you that are set under Preaching, if you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted whilst you are young, it is a thousand to one, if ever you are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Pray Sirs consider, Is it usual for God to Convert Old Sinners? I know, <hi>God</hi> sometimes may call at the Eleventh Hour, but it is but here and there one, now and then one; and commonly they are such as did not sit under the means of

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:179404:53"/> in all this time! O you that are Young, for you are my hopes! I profess that I have more hope of you, than of those that are Old and Wicked. I take it to be my great advantage, that I Preach to so many that are young; think of what has been said to you, and what has been spoken to you, and when you come home, consider, you have heard Ten Things, that there is no room for loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; and you that are Old things, if you are not past feeling. O would to God you were not! This is the Mischief, when People are young, then they think it is too soon; and when they are old, then they say, they have been of this Opinion ever since they were born, and change now they will not. Well, think what you will, change you must, or you must be Condemned. You would think it much to wait upon a Fellow-Creature a Day, or Week; yet this Blessed God has waited upon you so many Years, O make hast and come unto God, and do not delay any longer.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Then to you that are of a strong and a healthful Constitution, do you make hast and not delay to do what God commands you, though you are
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:179404:54"/> strong and healthful, yet make hast and do not delay; you have need of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, because being strong, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, you are apt to put away the day of Death from you, and Repentance too, and Christ too; and the making of your Peace with God, because you are not full of Pain, and God does not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cast you upon Beds of Sickness, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you think there is no need for you to make hast.</p>

            <p n="2">II. Tell me, Who is it that give thee thy strength? Is it <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> If it be <hi>God</hi> that gave thee thy strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Does God make thee strong, that thou mayest be strong to sin, and spend thy days in sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Consider, which is the fittest time for you to Repent, and to make your Peace with God, now when you are well and strong, or when you shall be sick and near Death? Alas! How oft have I seen People on their sick-Beds unfit to be discoursed with, that put off their Repentance till the last, till they were fick; then sickness brought its Burthen with it, its Excessive Pain with it, that they had no mind to Discourse of any such Things. That is the Third Sort, to those that are strong.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. My Exhortation also is to such of you as are sickly and of a weak Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that are often sick, and often ill. It is time for you to make hast, that live in daily expectation of another World, that daily look for your last Day, and when your laft Hour will come, and when you shall draw your last Breath. How oft has God shaked
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179404:55"/> thee over the Grave? How oft hast thou been in that case upon thy sick bed, that Men could not tell, whither thou shouldst Live, or Die? And now God has restored thee, yet thou art weak still and sick still. Is it not time for you to make hast? Behold! The Voice of every Sickness is, <hi>Sinner, make hast;</hi> The Voice of every Affliction is, <hi>Sinner, make hast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. And Lastly, My Advice is to such as have been Sick, and now are Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; do you make hast and not delay to do what God has commanded you to do: Will you sin again as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Will you slight <hi>Christ,</hi> again, as you did before? and neglect <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as before? Sinner, Did <hi>God</hi> give thee thy Life again, that thou shouldest rebel against thy <hi>Makes</hi> again? Hast thou forgot how thy Soul was filled with amazement and horror when thou thoughtest thy Soul was so near to another World? How didst thou beg, and cry, and call, <hi>O that God would restore me this once! O that God would give me a little more time! O if God would recover me, I will become a new Man, I will forsake my sinful Companions, I will
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179404:55"/> neglect Prayer no more, I will prophane God's Holy Day no more!</hi> These were thy Promises; God has restored thee again, and hast thou so soon forgot what thou didst Promise unto God, and dost thou delay as much as before? O consider, and for God's sake lay it to Heart. Didst thou tell a Lye to God, when upon thy sick Bed: and didst thou play the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite with God, when thou didst not know whether thou shouldst live or dye? Therefore, you that have been upon the brink of the Grave, and God bid thee look into Eternity, and thou sawest thou wast not prepared, thou beggest a little longer time, and God spared thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now make hast.</p>
            <p>Now it may be thought, that I have said enough upon this Subject; but, alas, I think have never said enough upon any Subject, till I have gained your Hearts to do what I have Preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when I consider, how slothful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men are, how backward to come to God and Christ, how backward to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to Repent, and be Holy, I think that there is Reason enough to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der still, what more is to be said, to press you to make hast, and I beseech you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179404:56"/> to Answer these following Questions, and let Conscience answer as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> along.</p>
            <p>First of all, Tell me, Sinner, Who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it that does wait upon thee, while thou dost dely? Is it not the Blessed, and Glorious, and Eternal God? Is it n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it not he, sinner, that might have Danm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee long ago, and cast thee dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> into Eternal Torments, and thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this day have been among Damned Devil? Dost thou do well to make h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tarry for thee? Is it not he that Did for thee, that is infinite in Mercy to say thee, if thou comest in; that is Infinite in Power to Damn thee, if thou refuse? Is it not he, that is infinitely thy Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judge? Now, if it be reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> thee to loyter any longer, do if thou darest; do, I say, at thy Peril.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Who, or what art thou Trifler, that this Blessed God should wait thus upon thee? If we consider thee, as thou art a Creature, or as thou art a Sinner, Why should God so w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon thee one year after another? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> thou art a Creature, Is not thy Body
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179404:56"/> made of dust, and must not thy Body e're long be turned into dust? What art thou, but the better sort of <hi>Clay?</hi> Dost not thou carry every day a very Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill about thee, and must the Blessed <hi>God</hi> wait upon thee? Besides, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thee, as thou art a <hi>Sinner;</hi> Art not thou a Hell deserving <hi>Sinnor!</hi> May not <hi>God</hi> cast thee this day into Hell if he will, and into Torments, even this very hour if he will? Canst thou be happy without his Favour, and enter into Heaven without his Son, and be saved without his Mercy? Therefore delay any longer at thy Peril.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is it for, that this <hi>God</hi> thus waits upon thee? Consider I pray you, What does <hi>God</hi> give you so much time for, one Week after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one Month after another, Year after year? Is it not to make your selves Rich in this World? O no, it is about a greater Matter that God waits and stays? Is it not to see if thou wilt mind thy escaping Eternal Damnation! <hi>God</hi> gives thee thy time for this, that thou mayest escape an Eternity of Torment: Is it not for this that <hi>God</hi> waits, think you</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:179404:57"/>2. That God stays so long, Is it not that thou mayest mind the Everlasting Salvation of thy Soul in Glory, that thou mayst get a Title to his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that thou mayst get an Interest in his Son, that thou mayst hereafter dwell with him, with his Son, and with his Spirit with his Angels and Saints, when thou shalt be taken out of this World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not that God stays, that thou mayst be Justified, Sanctified, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? O Sinner, if God had not stay'd for this, he might have Sentenced the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Is it not that God does stay, that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. That thou mayst be cured of thy Soul-distemper, and of those sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not for this, I say for this, that God waits upon thee.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Tell me, who shall have the worse of it, or who shall be the Sufferer if thou still delayest and dost not make hast to Repent, Believe and be Holy? Or who will be the better, if that thou make hast to be Holy and Repent? Whose will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179404:57"/> the Profit be, and the Advantage be? If thou dost not, Will not the harm be thy own, and will not the wrong be thy own? Sinner, dost thou think that <hi>God</hi> thus waits upon thee, because he cannot be happy without thee? Flatter not thy self with this; for this <hi>God</hi> was happy before thou wast, and if thou art Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, this <hi>God</hi> will be infinitely happy and blessed without thee, <hi>Job. 22. v. 2. 3. Can a Man be profitable to God, as he that is Wise, is profitable to himself: Is it any Pleasure to the Almighty that thou art Blessed or is it any gain that thou makest thy self hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?</hi> Job. 35. 6, 7, 8. <hi>If thou sinnest, What dost thou against him? Or if thy transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be Multiplied, What dost thou to him? Or if thou art Righteous, What dost thou give unto him? Thy Ʋnrighteousness may prejudice a Man as thou art, and thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness may profit him.</hi> It is a matter of Admiration, that the Blessed God should so long wait upon Sinners, or that the foolish Sinner should so long delay to come to God.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Tell me, is it not <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> that is the issue of thy <hi>loitering</hi> or making hast, yet wilt thou <hi>loiter</hi> and delay, in respect of Eternal Life and Eternal Death too?

Do it at thy Peril.</p>

If the Work be never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o mean that you put your Servants to, and bid them do it quickly, if they do not do it, you are Angry; if thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest him but cleanse thy Shoes, if he does not do it, thou art Angry. Behold! The Blessed <hi>God</hi> commands thee, to look after the cleansing of thy Soul, and the cleansing of thy Heart, the getting of an interest in <hi>Christ;</hi> and wilt thou be Angry if thy Servant will not do for thee, and wilt thou delay doing for <hi>God?</hi>

What to do in this World more than to get off the guilt of Sin, to get a holy Heart? And yet to delay! Thou dost put all to a Hazard. Methinks your delaying to do what <hi>God</hi> commands, it is a putting of things to a venture, it is a putting your Salvation to a venture, it is a putting of your Damnation to a venture, it is a putting the Loss of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> to a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               </gap> a Wise Man.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:179404:65"/>
               <item>1. That he be one that maketh choice of the best good.</item>
               <item>2. That he be one that taketh care of the best part.</item>

            <p>This is the Wise Man, Behold, <hi>God</hi> is the best good, thy Soul is the best part, the way of Holiness is the best way, means appointed by <hi>God</hi> to get to Heaven, are the only means. But on the contrary, to neglect these it is a sign of the greatest Folly: Wilt thou do it still? Venture on at thy Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Tell me, Do not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of People greatly discourage the Faithful Ministers of the Gospel? Does not your delaying weaken our Hands, and discourage our Hearts, when we must Study for you, and Pray for you, and Preach to you, and you cast it again
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179404:66"/> in our Faces? Do you think that we can Preach with Life, when we see no Fruit of our Works? I profess, were it not for some of you, you would even tempt me to Preach no more to you, were it not the Command of God to continue my duty. You see, <hi>Isa. 49. 4. Then I said, I have laboured in vain, and have spent my strength for nought, and in vain;</hi> When he could not see the fruit of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So Ministers may say, Lord, we have laboured in vain, and have spent our strength for nought, and in vain. <hi>Jerem. 20. 8, 9. For since I spake, I cried out, I cried Violence and Spoil, because the Word of the Lord was made a Reproach unto me: Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name.</hi> And by your delaying, when we come Year after Year, and Preach Month after Month, and see many of you in your Sins still, and walk in your wicked ways; Do you think that this is not a great Discouragement unto Ministers? And do you think, that God will not lay this to your Charge, to weaken the hands of his Servants? Do it at your Peril.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:179404:66"/>
            <p>Tenthly, and Lastly, Dost not thou think, O delaying Trifler! Dost not thou know, that every thing that thou settest thy Heart upon, is hastening from thee, and every thing thou lovest is hastening away, and yet, wilt not thou make hast to get something that thou maist need, when all that now thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est will leave thee? Sinner, Dost not thou know, that thy time is a going, thy Health is a going, and that thy Life is a going; and yet wilt not thou make hast? Know, I say,, know if thou dost not hasten unto Christ the sooner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, thou shalt e're long be Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without delay.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, I have given you Ten Questions more; Has this done the Work? Are you now resolved to go home, and enter into Covenant to be the Lord's? Are you now resolved to forsake your Sins, and to let go your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities? I doubt you are not; some of you will keep your Sins still, and will not come to God. Possibly, there are Two Things secret in thy Heart, let me remove these that bear thee up in thy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179404:67"/> delay. Possibly thou thinkest, Why Sir, why such hast? Is not God a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, a long-suffering God? Is not God ready to forgive, and has he not promised so to do? And if I repent hereafter, God will Pardon me hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Why such hast then? I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is true, Sinner, that God is a merciful God, else Woe would have been thy Case long ago. It is true, <hi>God</hi> is a Patient <hi>God,</hi> a long-suffering <hi>God,</hi> else thou wouldst not have been hearing of a Sermon now, but have been amongst Devils and Damned Souls at this time: But what if it be so, and thou misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble But I Answer partieularly: Tell me,</p>
            <p>First, Art thou sure that thou shalt see that time, when thou dost purpose to Repent? If so be that the Devil, of thine own Heart would delude thee, now thou art young, to Repent when thou art a Man, Art thou sure to live till thou become a man? If not, where will thy Soul be then? Is it not then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Repent now without delay?</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:179404:67"/>
            <p>Secondly, Art thou sure to have the same means of <hi>Grace</hi> then as now?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Art thou sure, that the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> will strive upon thy Heart, and move upon thy Heart then, as now he does? If thou art not sure, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived; for though <hi>God</hi> be patient, yet he may cut in two the Thread of thy Life, before thou seest those days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou purposedst to Repent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I suppose all to be true, that thou mayst live longer, and thou mayst Repent at last, and <hi>God</hi> Pardon thy Sin at last? What then? Is this thy Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, to Sin against God now, because thou hopest that <hi>God</hi> will be gracious and Merciful to thee hereafter? I thought, thou hadst been a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Person: Wouldst thou deal thus with a Friend, with a Man? But you say, What need such hast? Some Repent at the Eleventh Hour; all do not Repent while Young. To this I Answer.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If some are then brought in, yet it is not all that do stand out till then?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179404:68"/> No, it is but very few; it is a very rare thing to see Persons Converted, and brought home to Christ at the Eleventh Hour. Sometimes <hi>God</hi> may do this, and truely, it is but sometimes. Pray, how many is it that you know, that were Converted when they were Old, and sate under the Means of Grace while they were Young? I suppose you can tell but of very few. It is but now and then, and wilt thou put it to a Hazard, whether God will make thee such an Example? I could never find it Recorded in the Scripture, but of one Man, that was Converted at last, and that was the Thief upon the Cross? I do not say, there was no more, but no more Recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6, 7. You Object, that some came in at the Eleventh Hour; I pray view that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that is, Those that came in at the Eleventh Hour, they were not Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till the Eleventh Hour; Those that were Called the Third hour, came in the Third Hour; And those that were Called the Sixth hour, came in the Sixth hour; and those that were Called the Ninth hour, came in the Ninth hour;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179404:68"/> but those that came in at the Eleventh hour, they were not called at the Third, nor Sixth, nor Ninth, but at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour. Now, what is this to you, that have been Called an Hundred Times over, that have had Call after Call, and Invitation after Invitation? For when Men are called at the Third and Sixth Hours, and do not come in, they seldom come in at the Eleventh Hour. What say you, beloved Hearers, shall I, after these Sermons, and after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an hundred things spoken to you, and all to this purpose, to press you to make hast, and not delay, shall I go away from your Presence and your Sight, and will you turn your back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and say, <hi>Yet a little longer, yet I must enjoy my Pleasure, yet I must mind the World:</hi> As if you had no room in your Hearts for God and Christ, or the things above? I would fain prevail; if I could but prevail with some upon this one Subject, whatsoever I should Preach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I should have the greater hopes to speed upon those Subjects too. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then a little more to move you.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179404:69"/> First of all, If thou wouldst make hast and now keep God's Commandments thou shouldest be Blessed now, thou shouldest be happy now, and will not this make you to make hast? Tell me, Sirs, Have you a mind to go home Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, to go home with the Love of God? Oh! If you would go home Happy, Men and Women make hast, delay no longer to keep the <hi>Commandments</hi> of your <hi>God. Christ</hi> himself pronounceth you Blessed, if you will but do this <hi>Luke 11. 27, 28. It came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain Woman of the company lift up her Voice to him</hi> (that is, to <hi>Christ) Blessed is the Womb that bare thee, and the Pap that gave thee Suck.</hi> Ah says she, What a Blessed Woman was that, which bore this Man! But says <hi>Christ, Yea, rather bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they which hear the Word of God and keep it;</hi> that hear God's <hi>Commands,</hi> and keep them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This keeping of God's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> would be an Evidence to you of your Love to <hi>God?</hi> Wouldest thou know that thou lovest God Wouldest thou hnow this? Then do
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179404:69"/> what <hi>God</hi> Commands: Keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Obey his Precepts, hereby thou maist know, that thou lovest him, <hi>John 14. 21. He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> 1 John 5. 3, 4. <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments. Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Christ's <hi>Person, and keeping of</hi> Christ's <hi>Commandments,</hi> they usually go together. In the Second, <hi>Those that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you will but make hast to keep Gods Commandmants, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve when he Commands, and close with Christ when he Commands, <hi>God</hi> will make hast, and hear thy Prayer? when thou pourest out thy Prayer to God, <hi>O Lord make hast, and do not tarry;</hi> then God will make hast, and hear thy Prayer. Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by doing those things that are pleasing in his sight, <hi>Prov. 1. 24, 28. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have called, and ye have refused.</hi> Remember me, Sirs, that if you lie a dying, and should call to <hi>God</hi> for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon a Death-Bed; if you should lie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179404:70"/> a dying, when your Soul is departing, should call to God to save it, yet he would not hear your Prayer: If you neglect to keep the Commandments of God, and for God to neglect to hear the Prayers of a dying Man, What a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful case is this?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you make hast to keep the Commandments of <hi>God,</hi> he will make hast actually to keep thee when in Trouble and Temptation. Sirs, if You would make hast to keep the Commandments of <hi>God, God</hi> would make hast, and would not stay beyond that Hour that Deliverance should be for thy good.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would make hast to keep God's Commandments, it would be the readiest way that you could do, to have a Blessing upon your outward Enjoyments, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. throughout.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If thou wilt do this, thou shall be saved when thou diest; What dost thou desire more? <hi>John 1. Verily, Verily, I say unto you, if any Man keep my Sayings,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179404:70"/> he shall never see death:</hi> That is, he shall never see Eternal Death, he shall never be damned: But you may say, Sir, you press us to make haste to keep God's Commandments; so you may, <hi>so we have;</hi> you make us a Disobedient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; I wish to God you were not. I say to you, have you kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God? What meaneth then the Passion that we see? What meaneth then the Pride that we see? What meaneth then all the Neglects of Prayer in your Families, that we know of? What meaneth then your hardness of Heart, your slighting of Christ? What are the Commandments of God? Is it not that you should repent? <hi>Acts 17. 20. Now God Commands all Men every where to Repent:</hi> Hast thou kept God's Commandments? What! And not shed one Tear for a Thousand Sins that thou hast Committed? Yet, dost thou say, That thou hast kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God? The Commands of God are, That thou shouldst Believe on Christ; turn and see, 1 <hi>John 3. 23. And this is his Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179404:71"/> Christ.</hi> Now is <hi>Christ</hi> kept without door and hast thou kept God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? <hi>Christ</hi> kept out of thy Heart? Yet, Have you kept the Commandments of <hi>God?</hi> O that you would do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you say! Make hast and delay no longer to keep the <hi>Commandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In hopes that you will, I shall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Ten Things, that will be the Joy of Angels, the Rejoycing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the Content of the Heart of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all, It is a Blessed and Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sight unto Angels, and to Men, to see an <hi>Offering God,</hi> and a <hi>Receiving Sinner,</hi> to see a <hi>Tendring God,</hi> and a <hi>Receiving-Sinner.</hi> In the Covenant of Grace, you may see <hi>God</hi> making Offers unto poor Souls, making Tenders unto poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yea, making great Offers and Tenders of needful things to the Souls of Men. In the Covenant, <hi>God</hi> offers thee Grace. <hi>God</hi> offers thee Peace, <hi>God</hi> offers thee his Spirit, <hi>God</hi> offers thee his Son, <hi>God</hi> offers thee his Kingdom, <hi>God</hi> offers thee Himself: What shall I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179404:71"/> say? <hi>God</hi> offers thee all that thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and <hi>God</hi> offers thee all that thou canst eesire. Oh, by this you may see on <hi>God</hi>'s part, an offering and a Tendring God: Ay, but let us see on the other side also, a Receiving and Accepting sinner. Methinks, Sirs, that you should heartily receive what God offers you in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> Methinks you should say, O Lord, dost thou offer Grace to me? Ah to me dost thou offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God. Then Peter opened his Mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.</hi> See, People set themselves as in the sight of <hi>God</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Sermon: And, what was it that <hi>Peter</hi> did Preach? <hi>Jesus Christ the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, and Lastly, which is the Fruit of all; It is a Blessed sight to see a Heaven prepared and a Sinner Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This is the fruit of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in your taking <hi>God</hi> for your <hi>God</hi> and your becoming his People. This sight we shall see, at the coming of our Lord, a Heaven prepared we shall see; Ay, and see Sinners Saved, see Multitudes go in; This we shall see, as the Fruit of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> Matth. 25. 34. <hi>Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come ye Blessed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:179404:79"/>
               <hi>the Foundation of the World.</hi> Now my Advice to you all is, That you would take this God to be your God, and give up your selves unfeignedly to be the People of this God; or woe be to the Sinner, if there be a God, but none of thine; if there be a Blessed God, but thou hast no Interest in him.</p>
            <p>Now therefore for God's sake Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for God's sake, and for thine own Souls sake, let me beseech thee, and intreat thee, as ever thou wilt find Mercy at the hand of God another day, come and take this God for thy God; come Sinner, come, as yet, it is not too late; as yet; Mercy may be had, and as yet, Grace may be found; while the day of Mercy lasts, and while the day of thy Life lasts, come in this Instant, and turn not thy Back and say, For all this I will keep my Sins still.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consider</hi> this. If thou wilt not have God for thy God, thou wilt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Covenant of Works,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179404:79"/> and thou wilt not be condemned by the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> Think of this, thou art <hi>Condemned</hi> by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse; for it is Written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are Written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Here is thy Doom, <hi>Cursed is every one,</hi> Man, Woman, and Child, every one, Bond and Free, Master and Servant, Husband and Wife; <hi>that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Hast thou done so? Hast thou continued in all things? No, not in one thing. Then you see that you are <hi>Condemned</hi> by the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works: What is thy <hi>Cure</hi> then? O the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace must help me: Ay, but thou art condemned there too, <hi>John 3. 18. He that believeth on him, is not Condemned; (but)</hi> Ay, but there is a <hi>but</hi> come; <hi>but he that believeth not, is Condemned already.</hi> For what? What, <hi>Because he hath broken the Covenant of Works?</hi> No, the Law Condemns him for that, for the Breach of God's Commands, and for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:179404:80"/> the Covenant of Works. What then? <hi>because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, that will condemn you for not performing: and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> that will condemn you for not Believing.</p>
            <p>O methinks, I am loth to leave you, till I see some or other strike Covenant with God and say, O I see I must take God for my God, or else, I am lost and undone, and that for ever; I am accursed by the Covenant of Works, and by the Covenant of Grace; the one for not Obeying, and the other for not Believing.

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:179404:80"/> Sinner, Death e're long will get upon his pale <hi>Horse,</hi> and will be Riding swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards thee; Ay, but <hi>Hell</hi> follows after; Were it not for this, Death were nothing; but Damnation follows after Death; and it will be the case of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that will not take <hi>God</hi> for their <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us a little <hi>Consider,</hi> what is in this <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> before you take <hi>God</hi> to be your <hi>God.</hi> I hope I shall work upon some of your <hi>Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consider,</hi> therefore, There are Two Things in this <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> and both of them exceeding Dreadful.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Exclusion from the Blessed God; Ah Sinner, as sure as thou hearest my Voice, wilt thou be shut out, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Blessed <hi>God,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Christ,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Angels,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Saints,</hi> if thou dost not take <hi>God</hi> for thy <hi>God,</hi> Matth. 25. 41. <hi>Depart from me ye Cursed;</hi> from me, from the Blessed Jesu; Oh! How miserable must that Man be that must be sent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179404:81"/> packing away from the Blessed Jesus. This is the Punishment of Loss; but if it were the loss of thy Pleasures only, and the loss of thy Friends only, this were nothing: Ah, but what things wilt thou lose, if thou diest before God and thy Soul agree? It will be the loss of a Loving <hi>God,</hi> the loss of a Blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; This will be thy loss, and thou hadst better lose Ten Thousand Worlds than this one God. And if thou art not in <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou wilt lose thy Soul. The loss of a Soul, <hi>What shall it profit a Man, if he gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul?</hi> It is not a small matter that thou maist lose, if God gain not thy consent, but it is a Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consider,</hi> It is thy own Soul, Sinner, that will be lost, if thou wilt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to take <hi>God</hi> for thy <hi>God.</hi> I would not be guilty of the Damnation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Soul for all the World. Tell me Sinner, Wouldst thou ruine another Man's Soul? Then why wilt thou ruine thy own? Whose Soul wilt thou mind if not thine own? And whose Soul wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou take care of if not thy own?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:179404:81"/>3. If so be thou dost not take <hi>God</hi> for thy <hi>God,</hi> thou wilt lose thy only Soul. Ah poor Sinner, Hast thou but one only Soul that must be Damned or Saved, and wilt not thou take care for thy own <hi>Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh take care and see to it, it is thy only Soul. Sirs, <hi>God</hi> has given to us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one but one only Soul, lose that, and thou losest all; if that be Damn'd all is Damn'd. Methinks, the thoughts of this should move thee to remember thy Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to remember thy only Soul, that when thou hast but one thou mayst se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the happiness of that one. In the Body <hi>God</hi> gives us many parts by pairs, Two Eyes, that if we lose one, we may see by the other; Two Ears, Two Hands, two Feet, that if we lose one, we may have the benefit of the other; but <hi>God</hi> has given Men but one only Soul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will be the loss of thy precious and immortal Soul. Were it the loss of a mortal <hi>Soul</hi> that should die, and cease to be, it could not be so much; but when it shall be the loss of an Immortal Soul, that cannot die, that cannot cease to be, this makes your Punishment the more, that will not come up to the terms of the Covenant. That is the First.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:179404:82"/>II. In the Eternal Death, is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Sense. All manner of Pain and Torments that a just and Angry <hi>God</hi> can lay upon thee to all Eternity. If you are willing to take this <hi>God</hi> upon <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant terms,</hi> he will make you happy; But if you will not, know to your Faces, this Day. That the Eternal <hi>God</hi> will Plague you for ever, will be thy Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Punisher for ever. <hi>Consider</hi> the Names by which that Place is called, where all that die without <hi>God,</hi> must be cast into, I will name but four or five of them, and those briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If thou diest without <hi>God</hi> being thy <hi>God</hi> thou must to Prison, as sure as thou standest here; so this Place is called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. There by the Prison you read of, is meant the Place of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the Place of the <hi>Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Every one that Dies before <hi>God</hi> is his <hi>Covenant God,</hi> must be cast into a place of <hi>Darkness,</hi> into a place of utter <hi>Darkness, Matth. 8. 12. The Children of the Kingdom shall be cast into utter Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Every <hi>Soul</hi> that goes out of this World before <hi>God</hi> be <hi>his God, shall be cast into a Lake of burning Brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21. 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every Soul that leaves this World
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179404:82"/> before God be his God in <hi>Covenant,</hi> will be <hi>cast into a Furnace of Fire,</hi> Matth. 13. 42. Where you see Hell is set forth by a <hi>Furnace of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, It is indeed a Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 28. Says the Rich Man there, <hi>O send to my Brethren, and tell them what I endure, that they may not come to this place of Torment.</hi> O have mercy on me, for I am Tormented Day and Night. Now what is this, for which you must be cast into such Torments? What for, For refusing of <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why art thou so loth, Sinner why, to take this God for thy God? Why, will he do thee any hurt? Besides, I might have shewn how, that Four Things will make your case exceeding woful? for fain I would prevail, though it were but with One or Two, to come over to God, and that will say; O Sir, I come with all my heart, to take this God for my God.</p>
            <p>First of all, If thou wilt not, thy Pains will be Universal Pains, all over thy Body, and all over thy Soul, no part of thy Body free, no part of thy Soul free; hereafter in <hi>Hell, Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> and all the Pains of <hi>Hell</hi> shall be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179404:83"/> Universal, every part sinned, and every part shall Suffer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They shall be extream too, Sinner, If thou wilt refuse this <hi>God</hi> to be thy <hi>God,</hi> he will inflict upon thee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Pain: Now to have Pain all over, and to be all over in extremity, What a sad case is this?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then they must be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, without intermission; not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Pain, and sometimes at ease; No, no, this is not the Case of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; no, there is no intermission, not for an hour, not for one moment in Hell: If so be you have a pain on your Body, for an hour or two, or in the night, and in the morning you have ease, what a refreshment is that? But for a Person to lie under the Pain of <hi>Gout</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> and Night and Day cryeth out, no ease no mitigation, not an hours rest all Night long: O consider, what it will be, not to have an hours rest to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not the least intermission!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As it shall have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, so it shall have no cessation. If it were Pain to continue for a Thousand Years, without an Hours Rest between, yea a <hi>thousand</hi> to that, and a <hi>thousand</hi> to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179404:83"/> that, it would be happy Tydings; but those that will not have <hi>God</hi> for their <hi>God,</hi> they must have Pain without ease, and without intermission, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>But, for one Thing more. Besides all this, Sirs, if you will not have this <hi>God</hi> for your <hi>God,</hi> your Covenant God, you will have something to Torment you in Hell, that Thousands of others never shall.</p>
            <p>Shall <hi>I</hi> tell you, Beloved Hearers, shall <hi>I</hi> tell you, you will have something <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
